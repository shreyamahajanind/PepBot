Is depression a mental illness?	Yes, [clinical depression](https://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/major-depression) is a serious, but treatable, mental illness. It is a medical condition, not a personal weakness.\n\nIt is also very common. Major depression is a clinical syndrome that affects about 6.7% of the U.S. population over age 18, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. Some estimate that major depression may be as high as 15%. Everybody at one point or another will feel sadness as a normal reaction to loss, [grief](https://www.webmd.com/balance/normal-grieving-and-stages-of-grief), or injured self-esteem, but [clinical depression](https://www.webmd.com/depression/depression-assessment/zz-expire), called "major depressive disorder" or "major depression" by doctors, is a serious medical illness that needs professional diagnosis and treatment.	https://www.webmd.com/depression/questions-and-answers-about-depression		[]	False	[]	143
Do children get depression?	Yes. Children are subject to the same factors that [cause depression](https://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/causes-depression) in adults. These include: A change in physical health, life events, heredity, or inheritance, environment, and chemical disturbance in the [brain](https://www.webmd.com/brain/picture-of-the-brain). It is estimated that 2.5% of children in the U.S. suffer from depression. In adolescents, it is estimated to be 4% to 8%.\n\n[Depression in children](https://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/depression-children) is different from the "normal" blues and everyday emotions that are typical in children of various ages. Children who are depressed experience changes in their behavior that are persistent and disruptive to their normal lifestyle, usually interfering with relationships with friends, schoolwork, special interests, and family life. It may also occur at the same time as (or be hidden by) [attention deficit hyperactivity disorder](/content/article/45/1663_51211.htm#ADHD) (ADHD), [obsessive-compulsive disorder](/content/article/45/1663_51211.htm#OCD) ([OCD](https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/obsessive-compulsive-disorder)), or [conduct disorder](/content/article/45/1663_51211.htm#ConductDisorder) (CD).	https://www.webmd.com/depression/questions-and-answers-about-depression		[]	False	[]	144
Can a lack of sleep cause depression?	No. Lack of sleep alone cannot cause depression, but it does play a role. Lack of [sleep](https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/ss/slideshow-sleep-disorders-overview) resulting from another medical illness or the presence of personal problems can intensify [depression](https://www.webmd.com/depression/ss/slideshow-depression-overview). Chronic inability to [sleep](https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/sleep-habits-assessment) is also an important clue that someone may be depressed.\n\nCommon triggers of [depression](https://www.webmd.com/depression/depression-tv/default.htm) include:\n\n*   Family history of depression.\n*   An abnormal reaction over the loss of a loved one through death, divorce, or separation.\n*   Interpersonal disputes.\n*   Physical, sexual, or emotional abuse.\n*   Major life events such as moving, graduating or retiring, etc.\n*   Serious illness. Major, chronic, and terminal illnesses often contribute to depression. These include cancer, heart disease, stroke, HIV, Parkinson's disease, and others.\n*   Substance abuse. Street drugs or heavy alcohol use can cause mood changes that mimic depression or other [mood disorders](https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/mood-disorders). In addition, some people with substance abuse problems also may have depression, bipolar disorder, or other mood problems even when they are not using mood-altering substances.\n*   Being socially isolated or excluded from family, friends, or other social groups.	https://www.webmd.com/depression/questions-and-answers-about-depression		[]	False	[]	145
Are there any alternatives to the traditional treatments for depression that I can try?	Alternative therapy describes any treatment or technique that has not been extensively scientifically documented or identified as safe or effective for a specific condition. Alternative therapy involves a variety of disciplines that include everything from diet to mental conditioning and lifestyle changes. Some of these have been found to be effective for [treating depression](https://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/depression-treatment-care). \n\nExercise, sometimes considered an alternative treatment, has gained increasing evidence for its ability to treat mild to moderate forms of depression. \n\nExamples of alternative therapies include [acupuncture](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/consider-acupuncture), guided imagery, [chiropractic](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/guide/chiropractic-pain-relief) care, [yoga](https://www.webmd.com/balance/guide/the-health-benefits-of-yoga), hypnosis, [biofeedback](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/biofeedback-therapy-uses-benefits), aromatherapy, relaxation, herbal remedies, [massage](https://www.webmd.com/balance/guide/massage-therapy-styles-and-health-benefits), and [many others](https://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/alternative-therapies-depression). If you are interested in trying any of these options, talk to your doctor.	https://www.webmd.com/depression/questions-and-answers-about-depression		[]	False	[]	146
How can you determine if an illness is causing depression or depression is causing an illness?	Illnesses that can lead to depression are usually major, chronic, and/or terminal. When an illness is causing depression, there is often long-term pain or physical disability present or there is a sudden change in lifestyle.\n\nDepression causes illness in a [different way](https://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/untreated-depression-effects). Like psychological stress, it can weaken the immune system (cells involved in fighting disease and keeping you healthy), allowing a person to get more colds or the [flu](https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/ss/slideshow-cold-or-flu). There is often a notable presence of "aches and pains" with no particular cause. Having depression may also cause the symptoms of another medical illness to last longer and intensify its symptoms, but the true relationship of depression-induced illness, in terms of major disease, has not been thoroughly defined.\n\nIt is important to seek the advice of your doctor if you think you or someone you know may have depression. Your primary care doctor is a good place to start. They can screen you for depression and develop a treatment plan to help manage your symptoms.	https://www.webmd.com/depression/questions-and-answers-about-depression		[]	False	[]	147
I've heard lots of warnings about drug interactions with certain depression medicines. What are they?	MAOIs, or monoamine oxidase inhibitors, are effective [antidepressant](https://www.webmd.com/depression/antidepressants-9/slideshow-antidepressants) medicines that have been used for years. Typically prescribed for people with severe depression, MAOIs improve mood by increasing the number of chemicals in the [brain](https://www.webmd.com/brain/ss/slideshow-concussions-brain-injuries) that pass messages between [brain](https://www.webmd.com/brain/rm-quiz-amazing-brain) cells. They have proven to work just as well as, if not better than, other antidepressant drugs, but they have more possible food and drug interactions.\n\nMedicines to avoid when taking MAOIs include all SSRIs (a group of [antidepressants](https://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/depression-medications-antidepressants) that includes [Prozac](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-6997/prozac+oral/details) and [Paxil](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-32900/paxil+cr+oral/details)) and certain pain medicines, including [Demerol](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-3914/demerol+injection/details) and [tramadol](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/mono-5239-TRAMADOL+-+ORAL.aspx?drugid=4398&drugname=tramadol+oral). There are also some [cough medicines](https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/cold-guide/cough-syrup-cough-medicine), decongestants, and [blood pressure](https://www.webmd.com/hypertension-high-blood-pressure/guide/diastolic-and-systolic-blood-pressure-know-your-numbers) medicines that should not be taken with MAOIs. Foods to avoid when taking MAOIs include aged cheeses and meats, pickled or smoked foods like sauerkraut or meat, and aged or fermented foods such as soy sauce or tap beer. It is important to tell your doctor about any medicines you are currently taking. Be sure to discuss the limitations, interactions, and possible side effects of MAOIs.	https://www.webmd.com/depression/questions-and-answers-about-depression		[]	False	[]	148
Why are women more likely to get depression?	Women develop depression twice as often as men. One reason may be the various changes in hormone levels that women experience. For example, depression is common during pregnancy and menopause, as well as after [giving birth](https://www.webmd.com/baby/guide/delivery-methods), suffering a miscarriage, or having a [hysterectomy](https://www.webmd.com/women/guide/hysterectomy) -- these are all times when women experience huge fluctuations in hormones. Premenstrual syndrome ([PMS](https://www.webmd.com/women/pms/ss/slideshow-premenstrual-syndrome-pms)) and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), an extreme form of PMS, may also cause depression.	https://www.webmd.com/depression/questions-and-answers-about-depression		[]	False	[]	149
Do most people with depression attempt to commit suicide?	No. Most people who suffer from depression do not attempt suicide, but according to Mental Health America, 30%-70% of [suicide](https://www.webmd.com/help/crisis-resources-old) victims have suffered from some form of depression. This figure demonstrates the importance of seeking professional treatment for yourself or someone you love if you suspect depression.	https://www.webmd.com/depression/questions-and-answers-about-depression		[]	False	[]	150
Will someone who has had depression get it again?	Having experienced an episode of major depression does put a person at greater risk for future episodes, but not everyone who has recovered from depression will experience it again. Sometimes depression is triggered by a major life event, illness, or a combination of factors particular to a certain place and time. Depression can also occur for no obvious ''reason." Getting the proper treatment for the correct amount of time is crucial to recovery and in helping prevent or identify any future depression.	https://www.webmd.com/depression/questions-and-answers-about-depression		[]	False	[]	151
How long does depression last?	If left untreated, various types of depressive disorders can last for months or sometimes years. A major depressive episode is characterized by a set of symptoms that typically lasts for a few months.	https://www.webmd.com/depression/questions-and-answers-about-depression		[]	False	[]	152
What are the major symptoms of depression?	Common symptoms include:\n\n1.  sadness\n2.  tiredness\n3.  trouble focusing or concentrating\n4.  unhappiness\n5.  anger\n6.  irritability\n7.  frustration\n8.  loss of interest in pleasurable or fun activities\n9.  sleep issues (too much or too little)\n10.  no energy\n11.  craving unhealthy foods\n12.  anxiety\n13.  isolation	Editorial		[]	False	[]	154
What Are the Main Causes of Depression?	Lots of things can increase the chance of [depression](https://www.webmd.com/depression/depression-tv/default.htm), including the following:\n\n*   **Abuse.** Physical, sexual, or emotional abuse can make you more vulnerable to depression later in life.\n*   **Age.** People who are elderly are at higher risk of depression. That can be made worse by other factors, such as living alone and having a lack of social support.\n*   **Certain** [**medications**](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/index-drugs.aspx)**.** Some drugs, such as [isotretinoin](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-6662/isotretinoin+oral/details) (used to treat [acne](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/acne/default.htm)), the antiviral drug [interferon](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-37/interferon+alfa-2b+injection/details)-alpha, and corticosteroids, can increase your risk of depression.\n*   **Conflict.** Depression in someone who has the biological vulnerability to it may result from personal conflicts or disputes with family members or friends.\n*   **Death or a loss.** Sadness or [grief](https://www.webmd.com/balance/normal-grieving-and-stages-of-grief) after the death or loss of a loved one, though natural, can increase the risk of depression.\n*   **Gender.** Women are about twice as likely as men to become depressed. No one's sure why. The hormonal changes that women go through at different times of their lives may play a role.\n*   **Genes.** A family history of depression may increase the risk. It's thought that depression is a complex trait, meaning there are probably many different genes that each exert small effects, rather than a single gene that contributes to disease risk. The genetics of depression, like most psychiatric disorders, are not as simple or straightforward as in purely genetic diseases such as [Huntington's chorea](https://www.webmd.com/brain/hungtingtons-disease-causes-symptoms-treatment) or [cystic fibrosis](https://www.webmd.com/lung/what-is-cystic-fibrosis).\n*   **Major events.** Even good events such as starting a new job, graduating, or getting married can lead to depression. So can moving, losing a job or income, getting divorced, or retiring. However, the syndrome of clinical depression is never just a "normal" response to stressful life events.\n*   **Other personal problems.** Problems such as social isolation due to other mental illnesses or being cast out of a family or social group can contribute to the risk of developing clinical depression.\n*   **Serious illnesses.** Sometimes, depression happens along with a major illness or may be triggered by another medical condition.\n*   [**Substance misuse**](https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/addiction/default.htm)**.** Nearly 30% of people with substance misuse problems also have major or clinical depression. Even if drugs or alcohol temporarily make you feel better, they ultimately will aggravate depression.	Editorial		[]	False	[]	155

What are the warning signs of suicide among college students?	Among college students who are depressed, some of the most important signs to watch for include:\n\n*   Having conversations about death and wanting to die\n*   Talking about not having any reasons to live or feeling like a burden on other people\n*   Discussing feelings of hopelessness, overwhelming pain, or a sense of being trapped\n*   A significant rise in reckless behavior such as the irresponsible use of drugs and alcohol\n*   Giving cherished personal belongings away\n*   Becoming increasingly nervous, isolated, and withdrawn\n*   Researching ways to commit suicide\n*   Buying a gun or other items that could be lethal\n*   Displaying rage, aggressive behavior, or severe mood swings\n*   Suddenly displaying uncharacteristic joy or calm\n*   Being unwilling to seek help\n\nMany college suicide stories point to additional risk factors. For instance, some students who kill themselves have a family history of suicide, mental disorders, or child abuse. Other students have experienced major academic, financial, or relationship losses.\n\nRegardless of a student's academic status or social popularity in college, suicidal thoughts and behaviors are cause for alarm. Immediate action should always be taken to help prevent the worst possible outcome.	Editorial		[]	False	[]	160
Tips for Preventing or Dealing With Depression in College	*   **Reflect on who you are right now**\n\nWhen was the last time you really thought about what makes you _you_? Put aside all of the labels that other people have given you. Instead, dig deeper—within yourself. Write down everything about yourself that makes you proud, including your values, personality traits, and achievements. And think about the things that give you joy, make you sad, or cause you anger or frustration. Be honest.\n\nAll of those things are clues to who you are at this moment. When you identify them, you stand a better chance of staying grounded and confident going forward. (It's always easier to go through changes when you are sure about where you're starting from.) Plus, knowing more about yourself in this way can help you recognize areas where you might trip up or need a little extra support or guidance.\n\n*   **Don't ignore your troubling feelings**\n\nWhen you're busy going to class, completing assignments, and tackling other day-to-day activities, it's easy to turn a blind eye to confusing feelings. But even if you're having trouble explaining exactly what you are feeling (and why), it's important to pay attention. Don't minimize what you are experiencing or let your feelings become more and more intense while trying to pretend that they aren't there.\n\nAdmit to yourself that you are feeling something unusual. Make a commitment to pay closer attention to what might be triggering those feelings. That way, you lower the odds of depression sneaking up on you. And even if you already have depression, you may catch it at an earlier stage when it can be more easily treated.\n\n*   **Get support from friends and family**\n\nIt's always helpful to have people in your life who will listen and offer encouragement. So, even if you are attending college far away from home, try to stay in touch with any supportive family members or friends who already know you well. Those bonds are important. Video chatting over Skype or Facebook is often a good way to do that. Try to set up regular times when you are both available and can share how you've been feeling.\n\nAnd don't overlook the potential support that might come from new friendships. By learning [how to make friends in college](https://www.trade-schools.net/articles/make-friends-at-college), you can start building a network of support that helps you feel more connected to the world.\n\n*   **Take everything just a step at a time**\n\nYou didn't become depressed overnight, and you won't recover overnight either. Unless you keep things simple, you run the risk of becoming overwhelmed by the bigger picture. So try to take each new challenge as it comes without looking too far ahead or making too many big changes all at once.\n\nAs Anne Lamott writes in _Stitches_:\n\n"We live stitch by stitch, when we're lucky. If you fixate on the big picture, the whole shebang, the overview, you miss the stitching. And maybe the stitching is crude, or it is unraveling, but if it were precise, we'd pretend that life was just fine and running like a Swiss watch. This is not helpful if, on the inside, our understanding is that life is more often a cuckoo clock with rusty gears."\n\n*   **Start developing positive habits**\n\nIt should go without saying, but abusing drugs or alcohol can slow down your recovery or kill it altogether. Why place more obstacles in your way? By the same token, it is vital that you establish a good sleeping routine and eat healthy, regular meals. That means not staying up all night to study, party, or watch Netflix. It also means avoiding sugary or convenient junk foods that don't nourish your brain.\n\nExercising on a daily basis has also been shown to help some people with depression. Moderate to strenuous physical activity releases chemicals in your brain (known as endorphins) that produce positive feelings. And the effect is frequently even better if you can spend part of your time outdoors under sunny skies or in a park or natural area.\n\n*   **Get out and get involved**\n\nWhen you have depression, college can feel like something that you need to escape from. It's why many depressed students become hermits and rarely go out, other than for classes or basic needs. But engaging in activities with other people can sometimes be a good way to give yourself a break from your darker feelings. And so can exploring a creative hobby outside of your place of residence.\n\nConsider volunteering as a way to get out and experience the positive rewards of helping people. Join a club at your school that aligns with your interests. Begin a small study group. Start drawing, painting, writing, or creating music outside or in a place where you feel free to express yourself. Or simply find a few people to dance with.\n\n*   **Be kind to yourself**\n\nTry to avoid turning every small mistake or disappointment into a major failure. Remember that nobody is perfect and nobody ever will be. Heck, some of our best learning happens when things don't meet our expectations or go as planned. It's OK to forgive yourself and move on. In fact, it's the healthiest thing to do.	Editorial		[]	False	[]	161

Anger Management 	**1. Count down**\n\nCount down (or up) to 10. If you’re really mad, start at 100. In the time it takes you to count, your heart rate will slow, and your anger will likely subside.\n\n**2. Take a breather**\n\nYour [breathing](https://www.healthline.com/health/box-breathing) becomes shallower and speeds up as you grow angry. Reverse that trend (and your anger) by taking slow, deep breaths from your nose and exhaling out of your mouth for several moments.\n\n**3. Go walk around**\n\nGo for a walk, ride your bike, or hit a few golf balls. Anything that gets your limbs pumping is good for your mind and body.\n\n**4. Relax your muscles**\n\n[Progressive muscle relaxation](https://www.healthline.com/health/what-is-jacobson-relaxation-technique) calls on you to tense and slowly relax various muscle groups in your body, one at a time. As you tense and release, take slow, deliberate breaths.\n\n**5. Repeat a mantra**\n\nFind a word or phrase that helps you calm down and refocus. Repeat that word again and again to yourself when you’re upset. “Relax,” “Take it easy, and “You’ll be OK” are all good examples.\n\n**6. Stretch**\n\nNeck rolls and shoulder rolls are good examples of nonstrenuous yoga-like movements that can help you control your body and harness your emotions. No fancy equipment required.\n\n**7. Mentally escape**\n\nSlip into a quiet room, close your eyes, and practice visualizing yourself in a relaxing scene. Focus on details in the imaginary scene: What color is the water?

Anger Management in college students	**1. Count down**\n\nCount down (or up) to 10. If you’re really mad, start at 100. In the time it takes you to count, your heart rate will slow, and your anger will likely subside.\n\n**2. Take a breather**\n\nYour [breathing](https://www.healthline.com/health/box-breathing) becomes shallower and speeds up as you grow angry. Reverse that trend (and your anger) by taking slow, deep breaths from your nose and exhaling out of your mouth for several moments.\n\n**3. Go walk around**\n\nGo for a walk, ride your bike, or hit a few golf balls. Anything that gets your limbs pumping is good for your mind and body.\n\n**4. Relax your muscles**\n\n[Progressive muscle relaxation](https://www.healthline.com/health/what-is-jacobson-relaxation-technique) calls on you to tense and slowly relax various muscle groups in your body, one at a time. As you tense and release, take slow, deliberate breaths.\n\n**5. Repeat a mantra**\n\nFind a word or phrase that helps you calm down and refocus. Repeat that word again and again to yourself when you’re upset. “Relax,” “Take it easy, and “You’ll be OK” are all good examples.\n\n**6. Stretch**\n\nNeck rolls and shoulder rolls are good examples of nonstrenuous yoga-like movements that can help you control your body and harness your emotions. No fancy equipment required.\n\n**7. Mentally escape**\n\nSlip into a quiet room, close your eyes, and practice visualizing yourself in a relaxing scene. Focus on details in the imaginary scene: What color is the water? How tall are the mountains? What do the chirping birds sound like? This practice can help you find calm amidst anger.\n\n**8.
